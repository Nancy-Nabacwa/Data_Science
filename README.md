   **Tuples and Stacks**
   
Tuples are a data structure made up of elements/ values separated by commas. This project entails all the details of tuples
(Accessing elements in tuples, manipulating tuples after turning into a list.)
Stacks are a linear data structure that holds a linear, ordered sequence of elements.
This is the first description of tuples and stacks. describing the Implementation of stacks, accessing elements in a tuple,
and creating tuples.Different methods of implementation of stacks are also described in this project.
