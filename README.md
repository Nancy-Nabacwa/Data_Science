   **Tuples and Stacks**
   
   This repository consists of both the tuple and stack files(tuples.py and stacks. py). These were pushed on separate branches(stacks branch and tuple branch)
Tuples are a data structure made up of elements/ values separated by commas. This project entails all the details of tuples
(Accessing elements in tuples, manipulating tuples after turning into a list.)
Stacks are a linear data structure that holds a linear, ordered sequence of elements.
This is the first description of tuples and stacks. describing the Implementation of stacks, accessing elements in a tuple,
and creating tuples. Different methods of implementation of stacks are also described in this project.
