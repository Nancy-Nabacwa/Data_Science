This repo includes the tuples, stacks and queues data structure
### [Go to Queues](#queues)
### [Go to Tuples](#tuples)

### [Go to Heaps](#heaps)
   ## Tuples
   Tuples are a data structure consisting of elements/ values separated by commas. This project entails all the details of tuples
   (Accessing elements in tuples and manipulating tuples after turning into a list.)

   ## Stacks
   Stacks are linear data structures with ordered sequences of elements. Different methods of implementation of stacks are also described in this project. ie using lists, deque from the 
   deque collections etc

   ## Queues
   A queue is an ordered list which follows the principle FIFO(First In First Out). Elements are inserted at the end/rear(enqueue) and deletion is performed at the head/front(dequeue)
   In this repo, methods of implementing queues are present. e.g. using lists, using two stacks etc.

   ## Heaps
   A Heap is a tree-based data structure commonly used to implement priority queues. There are two primary types of heaps: Min Heap and Max Heap

   In a Min Heap, the root node is the smallest element, and each parent node is smaller than or equal to its children. Conversely, in a Max Heap, the root node is the largest element, 
   and each parent node is greater than or equal to its children.

   ## Key Characteristics
   ### Completeness: 
   All levels of the heap are fully populated except for possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
   ### Heap Order: 
   Each parent node adheres to the heap property, meaning it is either smaller (Min Heap) or larger (Max Heap) than or equal to its children.
