# Data_Science
This repo includes the tuples, stacks and queues data structure
### [Go to Queues](#queues)
### [Go to Tuples](#tuples)
### [Go to Stacks](#stacks)
   ## Tuples
   Tuples are a data structure consisting of elements/ values separated by commas. This project entails all the details of tuples
   (Accessing elements in tuples and manipulating tuples after turning into a list.)

   ## Stacks
   Stacks are linear data structures with ordered sequences of elements. Different methods of implementation of stacks are also described in this project. ie using lists, deque from the 
   deque collections etc

   ## Queues
   A queue is an ordered list which follows the principle FIFO(First In First Out). Elements are inserted at the end/rear(enqueue) and deletion is performed at the head/front(dequeue)
   In this repo, methods of implementing queues are present. e.g. using lists, using two stacks etc.
